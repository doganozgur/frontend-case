# Frontend Case
This project was built with React, Redux, Redux-Saga, styled-components.

### To run this application
In the root directory, you can run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### About the completion
I faced an issue building brands and tags filtering section functionality. Although I had the data and the rest was simply filtering two arrays, a problem appeared that I could not fixed up until now. I have a guess that It might be related to asynschronous fetch from Saga, I will be further checking and updating on GitHub.
